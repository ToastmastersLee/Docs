# NDP500 Digital Podium Functional Summary

[toc]

### **Overview**

- **NDP500**: A standalone digital podium designed to create a smart classroom by integrating AV, device control, and network-based functionalities. The NDP500 is a standalone digital podium equipped with a 21-inch touchscreen, supporting both finger and active capacitive pen inputs, and an embedded 10-inch control screen for managing devices connected to the NDP500. It also features a built-in OPS module and comes with two standard wireless microphones (handheld and lapel). 
- **CBX Expansion**: With the addition of the CBX wireless communication control, the NDP500 can extend its capabilities to manage devices in larger spaces, such as auditoriums or lecture halls.
- **Classroom Cascading**: Multiple NDP units (including NDP500, NDP100, and NMP) can be deployed across different classrooms. Through cascading, they form a unified, campus-wide smart control solution.

### **AV Control**

- **Video Matrix Switch**: Manages multiple video inputs and outputs, allowing content to be displayed on multiple screens.
- **Primary Screen Synchronization**: Ensures consistent content display between the Interactive Pen Display and the classroom's large displays.
- **2x2 Matrix Touch Control**: Enables interaction with multiple screens (OPS, laptop, IFPs) via touch functionality.

------

### **Audio Control**

- **Speaker Output**: Routes audio from multiple sources (HDMI, wireless, wired mics) to connected speakers.
- **Multiple Audio Input Management**: Allows simultaneous output from various audio inputs.

------

### **Device Control**

- **Power Control**: Manages power distribution to connected devices like IFPs, projectors, and motorized equipment (e.g., projection screens, curtains).
- **IR Control**: Operates IR-enabled devices (e.g., air conditioners, projectors) via pre-learned IR codes or manual code input.
- **Serial Control (RS232/RS485)**: Allows control of devices like projectors and PTZ cameras through RS232 or RS485 communication interfaces.

------

### **Broadcasting**

- **Broadcasting Control**: Enables multimedia broadcasting, with remote command issuance via Q-NEX platforms, and content streamed from preloaded resources on a media server.

------

### **Live-Streaming**

- **Stream Distribution**: Supports live streaming by integrating with platforms like Q-NEX APP and Web Console to broadcast video content to connected NDP devices and screens.

------

### **Expanded Control: CBX**

- **Wireless Control via CBX**: Extends NDP control through wireless CBX units (2.4G Wi-Fi), managing connected devices like air conditioners, lighting, and IFPs via IR, relay, or RS232 interfaces.
