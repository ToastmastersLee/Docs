The Control Box (CBX) wirelessly connects to NDP100(NMP) using Wi-Fi 2.4G. Placed near devices like air conditioners, displays, lights, or smart curtains, the CBX acts as a bridge, enabling wired control of these devices without extensive cabling.

<img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

> For convenience, we will refer to the Control Box as CBX throughout this manual.

The CBX features three interfaces: IR, Relay, and RS232. These interfaces allow the CBX to receive commands wirelessly from the NMP and then relay them to connected devices using different control methods, such as infrared signals (IR), relay switches, or RS232 communication.

<img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

> Each CBX can control only one type of device at a time. For example, if you need to control both an air conditioner(via IR) and lights(via Relay), you must use two separate CBX units, each dedicated to a specific device type, CBX cannot manage multiple device types simultaneously.



With the CBX, device management is efficient and tidy, eliminating the need for extensive wiring or modifications. The CBX can be easily wall-mounted, allowing for quick and convenient installation.

### 5.1.3 CBX Paring 

#### 1. DIP Switch Configuration

Each CBX has a DIP switch with 2 toggle buttons. These buttons can be set to either the UP (OFF) or DOWN (ON) positions, creating a unique DIP switch combination. 

<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

> One NMP can pair with up to 4 CBX units simultaneously.

Each combination represents a unique CBX ID as shown in the table below. 

| **ID** | **Switch 1** | **Switch 2** | Illustration                                                 |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | UP (OFF)     | UP (OFF)     | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-1.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 2      | DOWN (ON)    | UP (OFF)     | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-2.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 3      | UP (OFF)     | DOWN (ON)    | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-3.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 4      | DOWN (ON)    | DOWN (ON     | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-4.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |

This ID is crucial for communication between the NMP and CBX. Once set, the DIP switch combination should not be changed to avoid communication failure.

To ensure successful pairing and control between the NMP and CBX units, please follow the instructions below:

1. When connecting the first CBX to the NMP, set the DIP switches to UP (OFF) + UP (OFF), corresponding to ID 1.
2. For subsequent CBX units, use different combinations from the table above to assign unique IDs (2,3, and 4).

<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

Once a DIP switch combination is set and the CBX is paired with the NMP, do not alter the DIP switch positions. Changes will disrupt communication between the NMP and the CBX.



#### 2. Paring and Setup

1. **Connect CBX and NMP, and Power On CBX**

   Connect the antenna to the front of the CBX before starting the pairing process. The antenna port is located on the front of the CBX.

   Ensure the CBX is connected to the NMP as illustrated in the diagram below. Make sure the power supply is connected to the CBX.

   <img src="./img/Connect-CBX200-NDP500.jpg"  style="zoom: 25%;" /> 

   **Line Type Representation: **

   | Lines                                                        | Descriptions                                                 |

   The diagram above illustrates the wiring sequence for connecting CBX-RS232 and NMP-PANEL. Each terminal on the CBX is connected to the corresponding terminal on the NMP PANLE, ensuring proper wiring of the cables.

   

2. **Initiate Paring Mode**

   Press and hold the reset button for 4-5 seconds until the indicator light turns red, then the CBX will automatically enter pairing mode with the NMP, indicated by a flashing green light.

   Once paired successfully, the green light will remain steady.

   

   **Indicator Light States:**

   | Indicator Light | Status               |
   | --------------- | -------------------- |
   | Green Flashing  | Pairing Mode         |
   | Green Steady    | Connected to NMP     |
   | Red Steady      | Not Connected to NMP |

3. **Post-Pairing Connections**

   After successfully pairing and removing the connection cable between the CBX and NMP, connect the devices to be controlled to the appropriate CBX interfaces based on their type. 

   For example, use the RELAY interface for controlling the power switch of lighting devices, the RS232 interface for display devices like IFPs and projectors, and the IR interface for devices with infrared remote controls, such as air conditioners, TVs, and electric curtains.

   

   <img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

   Each CBX can control only one type of device at a time. For instance, to control both an air conditioner (via IR) and light (via RELAY), two separate CBX units are required, each dedicated to a specific device type. A single CBX cannot manage multiple device types simultaneously.

   

4. **Configure CBX in the Dashboard**

   - Log in to the NMP/NDP management system Dashboard, and navigate to Devices > Device Management.

   - Select the NDP and click the CBX edit button to configure.

     <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-UI-Config.png"  style="zoom: 15%;" /> 

5. **Set Control Method According to the Controlled Device**

   Based on the DIP switch sequence, select the control method. (Power Control, RS232 Control, or IR Control)

   <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-UI-Settings.png"  style="zoom: 20%;" /> 

   <img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**:

   A CBX in a disabled state indicates that no device is currently connected to the NMP via Wi-Fi. 

   If you are certain that the CBX has been successfully paired and connected previously, please check the current network status of the CBX and ensure that it is properly powered.

   - For RS232-connected devices, set the device brand and model.

     <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-UI-RS232-Settings.png"  style="zoom: 20%;" /> 

   - For IR-connected devices, select the air conditioner and control options.

     <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-UI-IR-Settings.png"  style="zoom: 20%;" /> 



<img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

1. If the NMP/NDP is being replaced, re-pairing is required. Follow the instructions in the section "[Paring and Setup](#2. Paring and Setup)" from the first step to repair.
