#### Scenario 1: Integrating New Electric Lock via NMP

<img src="./img/Lock-Scenario1.png"  style="zoom: 25%;" /> 

In this scenario, the classroom initially does not have an electric lock, only traditional locks are installed. 

The electric lock control and power supply are both provided by the NMP (Networked Media Processor). 

When selecting electric locks, please ensure that the continuous operating current of the electronic lock does not exceed 800mA, and the operating voltage is 12V.



#### Scenario 2: Integration with Existing Electric Lock

In this scenario, the classroom already has an electric lock, and there is a desire to integrate the electric lock with the NMP (Networked Media Processor) for remote control via the Q-NEX platform. This situation can be further divided into two sub-scenarios:

##### 1. Partial Integration with Existing Electric Lock

<img src="./img/Lock-Scenario2-a.png"  style="zoom: 25%;" /> 

In this sub-scenario, the existing electric lock remains in place, ensuring that the original door switch wiring configuration remains unchanged. However, the Q-NEX platform can now control the electric lock for door opening.

It's important to note that while the NMP enables remote control of the electric lock, it does not manage the card access system in this setup. 

Additionally, manual door closing operations and automatic door closing delay configuration are responsibilities retained by the original electric lock



##### 2. Full Integration with Existing Electric Lock

<img src="./img/Lock-Scenario2-b.png"  style="zoom: 25%;" /> 

In this sub-scenario, the existing electric lock retains only the lock and lock power module. The NMP controls the opening and closing of the door. 

The NMP can be configured for manual door closing or automatic door closing with a delay of 5 seconds.

### 4.4.4 Broadcasting Process 

The broadcasting feature enables streaming of various audio and video formats, providing educators with access to a wide range of multimedia resources stored on the school's media server.

These resources can be utilized not only for teaching purposes but also for activities such as examinations, promotions, and other related applications.

1. Administrators can pre-publish the content on the media server.

2. Users can issue broadcasting commands via various terminals such as the Q-NEX APP and Web-Console over the internet.

   <img src="./img/image-20240418161642740.png"  style="zoom:15%;" /> <img src="./img/image-20240418161746582.png"  style="zoom: 15%;" />

3. Upon receiving the broadcasting command, the Media Server begins encoding the specified content into a streaming media and pushes the stream to the NMP.

4. The NMP decodes the streaming media and delivers the content to the IFP for display, while the audio is played through the speakers.



<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

Please note that NMP also supports text broadcasting, without requiring Media Server support

# 5. Expanded Control and Connectivity

This section covers additional components and functionalities that expand the control and connectivity capabilities of the NMP, including:

- **Control Box(CBX):** Exploring the features and setup of the Control Box, which extends NMP wireless control ability.
- **Media Box:** Understanding the Media Box, a component that enhances multimedia capabilities and connectivity options.
- **Divisible Room Integration:** Exploring how the NMP can be integrated into a divisible room setup for enhanced flexibility and functionality.



## 5.1 Control Box

The Control Box (CBX) wirelessly connects to NMP using Wi-Fi 2.4G. Placed near devices like air conditioners, displays, lights, or smart curtains, the CBX acts as a bridge, enabling wired control of these devices without extensive cabling.

<img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

> For convenience, we will refer to the Control Box as CBX throughout this manual.

The CBX features three interfaces: IR, Relay, and RS232. These interfaces allow the CBX to receive commands wirelessly from the NMP and then relay them to connected devices using different control methods, such as infrared signals (IR), relay switches, or RS232 communication.

<img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

> Each CBX can control only one type of device at a time. For example, if you need to control both an air conditioner(via IR) and lights(via Relay), you must use two separate CBX units, each dedicated to a specific device type, CBX cannot manage multiple device types simultaneously.



With the CBX, device management is efficient and tidy, eliminating the need for extensive wiring or modifications. The CBX can be easily wall-mounted, allowing for quick and convenient installation.

### 5.1.2 Topology Diagram

<img src="./img/CBX/CBX200-Topology.png"  style="zoom: 25%;" /> 





### 5.1.3 CBX Paring 

#### 1. DIP Switch Configuration

Each CBX has a DIP switch with 2 toggle buttons. These buttons can be set to either the UP (OFF) or DOWN (ON) positions, creating a unique DIP switch combination. 

<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

> One NMP can pair with up to 4 CBX units simultaneously.

Each combination represents a unique CBX ID as shown in the table below. 

| **ID** | **Switch 1** | **Switch 2** | Illustration                                              |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | UP (OFF)     | UP (OFF)     | <img src="./img/CBX/CBX-DIP-1.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 2      | DOWN (ON)    | UP (OFF)     | <img src="./img/CBX/CBX-DIP-2.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 3      | UP (OFF)     | DOWN (ON)    | <img src="./img/CBX/CBX-DIP-3.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 4      | DOWN (ON)    | DOWN (ON     | <img src="./img/CBX/CBX-DIP-4.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |

This ID is crucial for communication between the NMP and CBX. Once set, the DIP switch combination should not be changed to avoid communication failure.

To ensure successful pairing and control between the NMP and CBX units, please follow the instructions below:

1. When connecting the first CBX to the NMP, set the DIP switches to UP (OFF) + UP (OFF), corresponding to ID 1.
2. For subsequent CBX units, use different combinations from the table above to assign unique IDs (2,3, and 4).

<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

Once a DIP switch combination is set and the CBX is paired with the NMP, do not alter the DIP switch positions. Changes will disrupt communication between the NMP and the CBX.



#### 2. Pairing and Setup

1. **Connect CBX and NMP, and Power On CBX**

   Connect the antenna to the front of the CBX before starting the pairing process. The antenna port is located on the front of the CBX.

   Ensure the CBX is connected to the NMP as illustrated in the diagram below. Make sure the power supply is connected to the CBX.

   <img src="./img/CBX/Connect-CBX200-NMP.jpg"  style="zoom: 25%;" /> 

   **Line Type Representation: **

   | Lines                                                    | Descriptions                                                 |
   | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

   | --------------- | -------------------- |
   | Green Flashing  | Pairing Mode         |
   | Green Steady    | Connected to NMP     |
   | Red Steady      | Not Connected to NMP |

3. **Post-Pairing Connections**

   After successfully pairing and removing the connection cable between the CBX and NMP, connect the devices to be controlled to the appropriate CBX interfaces based on their type. 

   For example, use the RELAY interface for controlling the power switch of lighting devices, the RS232 interface for display devices like IFPs and projectors, and the IR interface for devices with infrared remote controls, such as air conditioners, TVs, and electric curtains.

   

   <img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

   Each CBX can control only one type of device at a time. For instance, to control both an air conditioner (via IR) and light (via RELAY), two separate CBX units are required, each dedicated to a specific device type. A single CBX cannot manage multiple device types simultaneously.



4. **Configure CBX in the Dashboard**

   - Log in to the NMP management system Dashboard, and navigate to Devices > Device Management.

   - Select the NMP and click the CBX edit button to configure.
