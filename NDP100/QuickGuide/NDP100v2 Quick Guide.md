# 3. Getting Started 

## 3.1 Unlock Digital Podium

1. Insert the key into the keyhole on the left side of the Digital Podium, and the sliding cover panel can be withdrawn.

   <img src="../UserManual/img/Slide-Cover-Key.png" style="zoom: 97%;" /> 

2. Use the **up / down** buttons on the tabletop, to elevate the Digital Podium's display to the desired angle.

   <img src="../UserManual/img/note.png"  /> **Note**: 

   If the display screen doesn't raise when pressing "Up," ensure the sliding cover is fully to the left.  

3. Unlock the Touch Panel  to activate the Q-NEX Digital Podium.

   After turning on the main power of Digital Podium on the Touch Panel, the following power sources will automatically turn on:

   - Phantom power(Gooseneck microphone)
   - Tabletop power outlet 
   - Switching Power Supply, which includes:
     - Interactive Pen Display power
     - Built-in PC (OPS) power
     - Motor power (Interactive Pen Display elevation and descent)

   When the main power supply of the NDP100 is turned off, these devices will be automatically powered off as well. It simplifies the operation of controlling NDP100's devices by one-touch control on Touch Panel.

## 3.2 Power and Network Access

<img src="../UserManual/img/NDP100-Power-Network.png" style="zoom: 53%;" />  

1. The NDP100 is equipped with an integrated switch and power strip.
2. Upon arrival in the classroom, connect the NDP100's power strip to the general power supply within the classroom to provide power to the NDP100. (Grounding work inside the NDP100 has been completed before shipment.)
3. Prepare a network cable with sufficient length. Connect one end to the switch of the NDP100 and the other end to the router in the classroom.

### 3.2.1 Connect Touch Panel to NMP

The Touch Panel is a 7-inch Android touchscreen device, custom-designed to work with the NMP (a core component of NDP100). Its applications are tailored specifically for controlling various functions of the NDP100, such as video matrix switching, volume and microphone control, as well as infrared and RS232 control, etc.

1. Enter IP Address: After connecting to the network, input the NMP IP address on the Touch Panel.

   <img src="/Users/leewang/Documents/Githubs/IQ/NDP/NDP100/用户手册/img/image-20240226184302159.png" style="zoom: 33%;" /> 


2. IP Address Retrieval: Referencing the '***Devices >> Processor Manage***' page, locate and retrieve the NMP IP address. Input this address on the Touch Panel interface and click 'Connect.'

   <img src="/Users/leewang/Documents/Githubs/IQ/NDP/NDP100/用户手册/img/NMP-Adding.png" style="zoom: 25%;" />  

   <img src="/Users/leewang/Documents/Githubs/IQ/NDP/NDP100/用户手册/img/note.png" />**Note**：

   If connection issues arise, use the router device or NMP config Tool.exe to identify the correct IP address, particularly in situations where DHCP changes may not be immediately reflected in the web-based backend.

## 3.3 Connecting IFPs to NDP100

<img src="../UserManual/img/NPD-IFPs.png"  style="zoom: 87%;" /> 

1. **Prepare HDMI Cable**: Ensure you have a sufficiently long HDMI cable to connect the IFPs to the NDP100.
2. **Connect HDMI Cable**: Plug one end into IFP and the other into NDP100's HDMI Out port, preferably HDMI Out B.
