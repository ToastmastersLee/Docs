# 5. Expanded Control and Connectivity

This section covers additional components and functionalities that expand the control and connectivity capabilities of the NDP100, including:

- **Control Box (CBX):** Exploring the features and setup of the Control Box, which extends NDP100 wireless control ability.
- **Media Box:** Understanding the Media Box, a component that enhances multimedia capabilities and connectivity options.



## 5.1 Control Box

The Control Box (CBX) wirelessly connects to NDP100(NMP) using Wi-Fi 2.4G. Placed near devices like air conditioners, displays, lights, or smart curtains, the CBX acts as a bridge, enabling wired control of these devices without extensive cabling.

<img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

> For convenience, we will refer to the Control Box as CBX throughout this manual.

The CBX features three interfaces: IR, Relay, and RS232. These interfaces allow the CBX to receive commands wirelessly from the NMP and then relay them to connected devices using different control methods, such as infrared signals (IR), relay switches, or RS232 communication.

<img src="./img/note.png"  />**Note**:

> Each CBX can control only one type of device at a time. For example, if you need to control both an air conditioner(via IR) and lights(via Relay), you must use two separate CBX units, each dedicated to a specific device type, CBX cannot manage multiple device types simultaneously.



With the CBX, device management is efficient and tidy, eliminating the need for extensive wiring or modifications. The CBX can be easily wall-mounted, allowing for quick and convenient installation.

<img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX200-Topology.png"  style="zoom: 20%;" /> 





### 5.1.3 CBX Paring 

#### 1. DIP Switch Configuration

Each CBX has a DIP switch with 2 toggle buttons. These buttons can be set to either the UP (OFF) or DOWN (ON) positions, creating a unique DIP switch combination. 

<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

> One NMP can pair with up to 4 CBX units simultaneously.

Each combination represents a unique CBX ID as shown in the table below. 

| **ID** | **Switch 1** | **Switch 2** | Illustration                                                 |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | UP (OFF)     | UP (OFF)     | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-1.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 2      | DOWN (ON)    | UP (OFF)     | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-2.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 3      | UP (OFF)     | DOWN (ON)    | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-3.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |
| 4      | DOWN (ON)    | DOWN (ON     | <img src="../../NMP/UserManual/img/CBX/CBX-DIP-4.png"  style="zoom: 50%;" /> |

This ID is crucial for communication between the NMP and CBX. Once set, the DIP switch combination should not be changed to avoid communication failure.

To ensure successful pairing and control between the NMP and CBX units, please follow the instructions below:

1. When connecting the first CBX to the NMP, set the DIP switches to UP (OFF) + UP (OFF), corresponding to ID 1.
2. For subsequent CBX units, use different combinations from the table above to assign unique IDs (2,3, and 4).

<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

Once a DIP switch combination is set and the CBX is paired with the NMP, do not alter the DIP switch positions. Changes will disrupt communication between the NMP and the CBX.



#### 2. Paring and Setup

1. **Connect CBX and NMP, and Power On CBX**

   Connect the antenna to the front of the CBX before starting the pairing process. The antenna port is located on the front of the CBX.

To connect the demo sample unit, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a network cable with sufficient length;
2. Connect one end of the network cable to the router of the NDP100.
3. Connect the other end of the network cable to the router in the classroom.

### 6.1.3 Local Control

In LAN mode, users can perform local control operations such as AV matrix switching and volume control directly through the demo sample unit. 

### 6.1.4  Remote Control and Broadcasting

<img src="./img/Demo-Pack-2.png" style="zoom: 15%;" />   

<img src="./img/note.png"   />**Note**: 

- Users can remotely issue broadcast commands over the Internet, while all audio and video resources are pre-stored on the Media Server.

To enable advanced remote control capabilities and access internet-based features, the demo sample unit requires permission to access the internet. 

If the school network implements network control measures, the router of the demo sample unit must be configured to allow access based on MAC and IP address filtering. 

Once configured, users can utilize the Q-NEX APP, Web-Console, and Touch Panel to access higher-level remote device control functionalities, including AV broadcasting.



### 6.1.5 Upgrading to Production Environment

If customers wish to incorporate the Demo Sample Unit into the entire campus network as part of the NNP/NDP campus solution, the following steps are required:

1. Remove the router from within the NDP100 and connect the classroom router to the NDP100 switch. (The router provided with the demo sample unit only offers basic routing functionality and supports only 100Mbps bandwidth.)
2. Remove the Lite Media Server and replace it with an enterprise-grade media server. (Schools must possess an enterprise-grade media server to utilize broadcasting and live streaming functionalities properly.)
3. Utilize configuration tools to set the NMP IP address of the NDP100 to an IP address within the campus network.
4. If the school implements network control measures, contact the network administrator and refer to section [6.2 Network Environment Requirement](#6.2 Network Environment Requirement) for network configuration guidance.



## 6.2 Network Environment Requirement

To ensure optimal integration, the school network needs to meet specific requirements tailored to the NDP. 

1. The school should allow NDP to access the Internet.

2. Whitelist Network Control Requirements:

   If the school employs whitelist network control, the following domains should be added to the whitelist:

   - "https://qnextech.com/" (Primary Domain)
   - "https://mg.qnextech.com/" (Secondary Domain).

3. IP Address and Port Requirements:

   The school network should allow access to the following addresses:

   - 110.90.11.185:80 (HTTP)
   - 110.90.11.185:443 (HTTPS)
   - 110.90.11.185:12573 (NDP Communication Service)
   - 27.151.13.85:12583 (NDP Upgrade Service).

4. MAC Address Control Requirements:

   If the school implements MAC address control, the MAC addresses of the following devices should be added to the allowed access list:

   - NDP
   - Touch Panel
   - Built-in PC (OPS).

5. NDP Network Configuration:

   - NDP must be connected to the **router** via a **wired connection**; NDP does not support wireless network connection.
   - NDP and Touch Panel should be on the same LAN. 
   - If there is a Media Server (broadcast and live streaming), ensure that the Media Server, NDP, and Touch Panel are on the same LAN.
   - The firewall should open the following ports for the Media Server:
     - 12570 (Broadcast Port)
     - 1935 (Streaming Port)
     - 80
     - 443

6. NMP IP Address Setting:

   - To prevent issues caused by NMP IP changes, it is recommended that the NMP IP address be set as static.
   - Ensure that before the initial use of NDP, the Touch Panel successfully connects to NDP using this IP.

7. VLAN:

   NDP does not support VLAN. NDP, Touch Panel, and Media Server should be connected to the campus network as described above but should not be on VLAN.



# 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)



## 7.1 Why doesn't the 'Up/Down' button work?

If the 'UP / DOWN' button is not functioning, it may be due to the advanced 'Limited Switch' feature incorporated into the NDP100 podium.

This safety mechanism restricts the activation of the 'UP / DOWN' button when the sliding cover is not fully positioned to the left. This restriction is in place to prevent potential motor damage and ensure operational safety.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the sliding cover is fully positioned to the left before attempting to use the "UP / DOWN" button.

## 7.2 The Unified Power Switch didn't activate?

If this issue occurs, make sure 'Display' is selected under 'Startup Options' in the 'Dashboard > Processor Manager > Editing Device' on the Q-NEX Dashboard management platform.
